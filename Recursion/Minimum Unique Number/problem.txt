Given an array of N integers, write a program to remove K elements from it such that there are minimum number of unique integers left in the array and print the number of unique integers.

Input format: Read the input from standard input stream. The first line gives the value of K and N separated by comma. The second line gives the integers separated by comma.

Output format: Print the number of unique integers to the standard output stream.

Sample Input		
3,10
1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6	

Sample Output:
4	

Explanation:
After removing 1, 2, 3 from the input, 3,4,4,5,5,6,6 will be left in the array. Hence the unique elements left in the array are 3,4,5,6. Hence the count is 4.
