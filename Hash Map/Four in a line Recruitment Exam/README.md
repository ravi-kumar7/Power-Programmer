Write a program that checks whether an m Ã— n martix (m,n>=4) contains four consecutive numbers of the same value either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If it does, print true. Print false otherwise.

Input format:

The first line contains the value of m and n separated by a space.

The next m lines contains the row elements separated by space.

Read the input from standard input.

Output format:

Print 'true' if 4 consecutive numbers are present in the matrix, 'false' otherwise.

Print the output to standard output.
